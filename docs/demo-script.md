# **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode & MCP Demo**

This demo app can be used to show a number of Copilot features:

- **Agent Mode and Vision**: generate a fairly complex UI updated (add the Cart functionality to the site) all with a natural language prompt and an image
- **Unit Testing**: run and generate unit tests to improve coverage
- **MCP Server**: 
  - generate a `.feature` file (Behaviour Driven Development/Tesing file)and use Playwright to launch a browser and test the scenario
  - Interact with GitHub via the GitHub MCP server
- **Custom instructions**: personalize how Copilot responds by pointing to a fictional private observability framework that Copilot can work with, even though it is not a public library
- **Security**: 
  - Enable GHAS scans on the repo, and after finding a vulnerability, generate an autofix
  - Ask GitHub to find vulnerabilities in the code, then explain and fix them
- **Actions**: generate Actions workflows for deploy/publish
- **Infrastructure as Code**: generate Bicep or Terraform files for publishing
- **Padawan (SWE Agent)**: You can also ask Copilot to code via Padawan for some of the above scenarios by logging issues and assigning them to Copilot

### **About Up the Demo**

- **About the App:** This is a modern TypeScript web-app with separate API and Frontend (React) projects that you will enhance with Copilot Agent Mode, Vision, MCP Servers and GHAS/Actions.
- **Why:** Demonstrate how Copilot can analyze and enhance existing code automatically, understand images, vulnerabilities and testing and how you can extend Copilot's capabilities with MCP server.
- **Demos**: You don't have to do all these demos, or do them in order. Get comfortable with the scenarios and practice them and then mix/match according to your audience.
- **MCP Servers**: The GitHub MCP server runs via Docker. You will need to install Docker locally to run it (it should work fine in a Codespace automatically). I use Podman for my Mac. Install this _before_ you attempt this demo! You'll also need a PAT that has enough permissions for your demos. Details below.
- **Padawan**: If you want to use Padawan, you have to ensure that it is enabled on the repo, that Actions are enabled and that you have a branch protection rule for `main`. I recommend creating a PR required for changes to Default branch with 1 required reviewer.
- **Local vs Codespaces:**  
  - This demo can work in a Codespace - but some scenarios (like running Playwright tests) require that you work in a local VSCode (clone the repo locally)
  - The visibility of the API port (3000) must be set to `public`. I have set this in the port attributes of the devcontainer file, but it seems that this config setting isn't always obeyed. Check before the demo! If you forget this, you will see CORS errors when the frontend tries to reach the API.
  - Make sure you **PRACTICE** this demo _before_ trying it in front of customers
  - Remember, Copilot is non-deterministic so you can't always predict exact behavior. Make sure you are comfortable with this environment so you can pivot quicky!
  - You don't have to use **VS Code Insiders** Version unless you want to demo features that you know are in preview.
    - If you want to access the Insiders Version in the web-version of a Codespace, click on the gear-icon on the bottom-left and select `Switch to Insiders Version...`

### **Building, Running and Debugging the code**

Refer to [the build docs](./build.md).

### **Full end-to-end Azure Deplyment Demo (optional)**

This demo requires the following:
- `az cli` and `gh cli` for configuring the Azure environment as well as the repo (Environments and vars, as well as OIDC config)
- You will need an Azure Subscription, of which you have owner permissions
- To configure the environment, run `az login` and make sure you have selected the correct subscription.
- Run the following command: `./infra/configure-deployment.sh <repo-name>` and make sure that it completes successfully. If it does, you will have:
  - An Azure Service Principal, correctly configured for deployment
  - 2 Azure Resource Groups (one for Prod and one for Staging)
  - an Azure Container Registry (in the prod resource group)
  - 2 Environments in the Repo (Staging, Prod) with manual approval configured on Prod
  - Actions Variables - all the vars that are needed to run the workflows
  - OIDC configuration - the script configures OIDC connection for the repo/environments so you don't have to store any secrets in GitHub!

> **Note**: as an alternative, you can just generate the Bicep and Workflow files without actually executing them.

### **MCP Server install and config (optional)**

> You can skip the MCP Server demos if you want to, so this is optional. Also, you can run the GitHub MCP Server demo just fine in a Codespace, but will need Docker (or Podman or equivalent) to run the GitHub MCP Server locally. Also, the Playwright MCP Server demo will not work in a Codespace since it has to open a browser.

If you are wanting to show MCP server integration, you will need to set up and configure the MCP servers _prior_ to the demo. I have included the necessary `mcp` config in the [mcp.json](../.vscode/mcp.json) file. Open the file and use the HUD display above the servers to start them:

![](./mcp.png)

You can also use the Command Palette to start the MCP servers.

#### Start the Playwright MCP Server

- Use the cmd palette `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` -> `MCP: List servers` -> `playwright` -> `Start server`

##### Start the GitHub MCP Server

> Generate a fine-grained PAT that has permissions to read/write Issues and PRs, context and whatever other features you want to demo. You can create this at the org/repo level. I suggest creating a PAT and storing it in a key vault (or 1Password) so that you have it handy.

- This server runs via Docker image, so you will need Docker to be installed and running before starting this server. I use Podman on my Mac.
- Use the cmd palette `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` -> `MCP: List servers` -> `github` -> `Start server`. The first time you run this, you will have to supply a PAT.

> **Pro tip:** If you want to change the PAT, open the Settings json file. You will see `"id": "github_token" = ****` in the `input` section. Right-click on the `***` section to edit or clear the cached token. (The `***` is a GUI feature - the value is not actually stored in the json file)

### **Demo: Prompt Files**

  1. (OPTIONAL if you have the GitHub MCP Server configured): Ask Copilot to `create an issue in my repo to implement the Cart page and Cart icon`
  1. Show the issue in the repo
  1. Open Copilot and switch to "Ask" mode. Add the `plan` prompt to the chat.
  1. Attach the [cart image](../docs/design/cart.png) using the paperclip icon or drag/drop to add it to the chat.
  1. Enter the following prompt:
    ```txt
    I need to implement a simple Cart Page. I also want a Cart icon in the NavBar that shows the number of items in the Cart.
    ```
  1. Highlight that Copilot has suggested changes and planned the components to add/modify and even asked clarifying questions.
  1. Answer some of the questions if you want to refine the plan.
  1. Switch to "Agent" mode in Copilot Chat. Switch to `Claude 3.5 Sonnet` (a good implementation model) and enter this prompt:
    ```txt
    Implement the changes.
    ```
  1. Show Copilot's changes and how you can see each one and Keep/reject each one.
  1. Accept Copilotâ€™s suggested fixes.
  1. Go back to the Frontend app. Navigate to Products. Show adding items to the cart (note the icon updating). Click on the Cart icon to navigate to the Cart page. Show the total, and adding/removing items from the cart.

    # Guidelines for REST APIs
    
    For REST APIs, use the following guidelines:
    
    * Use descriptive naming
    * Add Swagger docs for all API methods
    * Implement logging and monitoring using [TAO](../docs/tao.md)
      - assume TAO is installed and never add the package
    ```
  1. Mention how there are best practices as well as a doc reference to the TAO framework (a fictional library). Open the [TAO](./tao.md) doc to show the library.
  1. Ask Copilot to `add observability to the Supplier route`.
  1. Show the changes - note that _this will not compile_ since TAO doesn't really exist!
